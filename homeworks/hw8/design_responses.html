				<ul>
					<li>
						<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
						<p>From this article, I learned about the concept of Dark Patterns, a deceptive design strategy that utilizes psychology to manipulate users into doing things they don't want to do, often at the expense of the user's experience and autonomy for the benefit of the company, which emphasizes the need for ethical considerations in design. </p>
					</li>

					<li>
						<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
						<p> My favorite part of the article shows how specific dark patterns manifest themselves through different types of dark patterns. Examples include "bait and switch", "forced continuity", and "friend spamming". This can remind us that many of these inappropriate designs do exist in our lives. Designers need to think ethically and be warned when designing for the web. </p>
