						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p>The choice of colors falls under the category of "easily perceived" accessible design. This means that the content of a website/app, especially text and images, should be easily visible, having a high enough color contrast ratio to be easily distinguishable from the background. Marketers and designers should also adhere to regulatory requirements for accessibility; legal constraints provide the most direct and effective means of regulation.</p>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> The article offers detailed and practical recommendations for ensuring color accessibility, including adhering to a minimum AA standard of at least 4.5:1 contrast between background and text. It emphasizes the importance of using messages and icons. This specific design guidance is crucial for me to follow as a UX designer. </p>
