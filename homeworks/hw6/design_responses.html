						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p>I learned that the proper use of animation in user experience design can direct attention and add a layer of intuitiveness to an interface. Moreover, the timing of the animation significantly impacts the user experience. For instance, the duration of an unfolding animation typically does not exceed 25 seconds. Additionally, exploring the speed and easing of the animation in detail can make the imagery more vivid.

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p>My favorite part is the discussion on easing, particularly the ease-in, ease-out, and ease-in-out curves. Before, my understanding was limited to the idea that we should incorporate these animations, similar to how they are used in video clips. However, it was enlightening to learn about how these curves influence the perception of motion on a webpage. The fact that they are based on physical laws from the natural world was especially surprising to me.  </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
							<p> If the animation is built correctly, then it is unobtrusive and does not distract the users from their goals. If it does, you either need to soften it or even remove it at all. That means that the animation shouldnâ€™t slow down the user or prevent them from performing the task. </p>
