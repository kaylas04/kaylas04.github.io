							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> In UI design, leverage Gestalt principles by simplifying shapes for quick recognition (Emergence), using partial elements to engage imagination (Reification), and maintaining recognizability across different conditions (Invariance). Introduce elements with multiple interpretations (Multi-Stability) to captivate interest, ensuring one clear interpretation to avoid confusion. These strategies enhance user interface intuitiveness, engagement, and consistency. </p>

							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> Applying Gestalt principles in UI design enhances clarity and engagement by organizing elements logically, enabling intuitive user navigation, and balancing aesthetics for optimal focus. Design techniques like closure allow for engaging interfaces by letting users' minds fill in gaps, while symmetry and asymmetry balance aesthetics and focus. Continuation guides users' visual flow, enhancing interface navigation and overall user experience.</p>
